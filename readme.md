## MeGu Sample code
A sample code writing Gu list from the Media Engine

# Requirements
./build.sh from a bash

## Special Thanks
This sample code wouldn't have been possible without the resources from the PSP homebrew community, which served as valuable sources of knowledge.
Thanks to **crazyc** from ps2dev.org, without whom the use of the Media Engine in the community would be far more difficult.
Thanks to all developers and contributors who have kept the scene alive and to those who continue to do so.
