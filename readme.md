## Me/Gu Sample code
A sample code writing Ge list from the Media Engine using Gu

# Overview
The main idea is to write/update a Ge list from the Media Engine and then signal its execution to the Graphics Engine using a small trigger on the main CPU.

# Requirements
./build.sh from a bash

## Special Thanks
This sample code wouldn't have been possible without the resources from the PSP homebrew community, which served as valuable sources of knowledge.
Thanks to **crazyc** from ps2dev.org, without whom the use of the Media Engine in the community would be far more difficult.
Thanks to all developers and contributors who have kept the scene alive and to those who continue to do so.
